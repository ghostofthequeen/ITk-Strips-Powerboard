The following items are present in this repository:
- First Presentation Slides.pdf are the slides I presented at an Instrumentation Meeting tying together the above files in a visual way
- Interlock Patch Panel Configuration Manual.pdf is an Overleaf document verbally detailing how to construct interlock boards and sensors, how to test components on the baords, and how to wire them within the massive test crate
- Interlock-Analog-Sensor-Models.py is code that evaluates and graphs sensor values given equations from the datasheets. This is particularly useful for the temperature sensors, since converting the resistor-type output to a voltage-type output is annoying
- Powerboard Massive Test Crate Connections.pdf is a visual diagram of how to wire the massive test crate
