The following items are present in this repository:
- Current-Attempt-Shieldbox-Cropping.py is code executing my current attempt of cropping the shieldbox region, which corrects the rotation and zoom of the image but does not use the fiducials to crop the shieldbox yet
- First-Attempt-Shieldbox-Cropping.py is code executing my okay attempt at cropping the shieldbox region, as detailed on Slide 8 of Fourth Presentation Slides.pdf
- Fourth Presentation Slides.pdf are the slides I presented at an Instrumentation Meeting tying together the above files in a visual way
- Skeleton-Shieldbox-ML.py is code attempting to use machine learning to read the shieldbox number, but has not been able to run/troubleshoot due to the lack of cropped shieldbox images in the testing set
