The following items are present in this repository:
- pbv3_eff_temp_scan data is the data collected from the thermal crate in the old Strips lab that was cycled through different temperatures and different DC loads. The files are sorted by temperature
- Fit-and-Graphing.py is the code used to display the DC-DC Efficiency data (e.g. heat maps, plots), as well as fit an equation to describe the efficiency in terms of temperature and output current
- Second Presentation Slides.pdf are the slides I presented at an Instrumentation Meeting tying together the above files in a visual way
